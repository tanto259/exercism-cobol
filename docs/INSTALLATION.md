# Installation

Unlike newer languages, COBOL has multiple well-maintained compilers, though each has their own benefits. 

## GnuCOBOL

GnuCOBOL is the Free Software Foundation's Free and Open Source COBOL Compiler. It transpiles COBOL into a C program before using GCC to compile that into an executable. Instructions for installation can be found [here][GnuCOBOL].

## IBM Enterprise COBOL

As a mainframe vendor, IBM maintains its own dialect of COBOL that works on its z/OS as well as other modern operating systems. As part of the [Open Mainframe Project's COBOL Programming Course][Open Mainframe], access to IBM Enterprise COBOL for z/OS can be obtained free of charge for educational purposes by applying at [COBOL Programming for VSCode][IBM COBOL].

I was considering adding Micro Focus's Visual COBOL, but because I don't know the terms of the license I'm not comfortable adding it here.
